This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation

## Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning
>In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 

>This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.

>What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

## Task 2 - Exploring Unsupervised Machine Learning
>From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## Task 3 - Exploring Decision Tree Algorithm
>For the given 'Iris' dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
