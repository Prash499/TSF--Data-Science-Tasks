This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation

## Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning
>In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 

>This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
